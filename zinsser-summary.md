# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Samir Sachdeva

Writing should be kept simple. The reader doesnâ€™t want to decipher complicated text. 
They want to get to the point and they should not have to read it two or three times to understand the meaning. 
Clutter is using complicated phrases to say simple things. There is no reason to add extra text. 
It just takes the reader extra time to get to the point. A lot of times clutter is used when the writer does not know 
what they are trying to say. By using big words, the writer thinks that the reader will assume he is smart.
